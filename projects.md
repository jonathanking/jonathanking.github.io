Using Long short-term memory (LSTM) based networks to forecast cardiac arrest events based on streaming bedside alarm data in intensive care units.

To be presented at [IEEE Engineering in Medicine & Biology 2018](https://embs.papercept.net/conferences/conferences/EMBC18/program/EMBC18_ContentListWeb_4.html). Contributed as a member of the Hu Lab at USCF between Dec 2016 and Aug 2017.

</div>

*FLT3 ITD Detector* is an alternative, cloud-based method for the discovery and analysis of Internal Tandem Duplications (ITDs) and other variants useful in diagnosing acute myeloid leukemia. Using an algorithm developed at [Plexxikon, Inc.](http://www.plexxikon.com), the application reports the location, length, sequence and other detailed statistics about each ITD with improved accuracy over existing assays. Academic publication pending.

Available now on Illumina's [BaseSpace](https://basespace.illumina.com/apps/1746745/).


## High-Frequency Bitcoin Trading

BitcoinHFT allows users to trade Bitcoin currency using bots that scan the news for market sentiment and trade with various strategies. Currently in simulation mode only.

<img alt="tandem" src="/images/tandem_dup.png" width="400px" />
</div>

A Wikipedia-style report on Tandem Duplications, genetic events that result in regions of DNA being duplicated in close proximity. The paper also discusses techniques for their detection and several proposed mechanisms for their genesis.
