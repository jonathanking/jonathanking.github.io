*FLT3 ITD Detector* is an alternative, cloud-based method for the discovery and analysis of Internal Tandem Duplications (ITDs) and other variants useful in diagnosing acute myeloid leukemia. Using an algorithm developed at [Plexxikon, Inc.](http://www.plexxikon.com), the application reports the location, length, sequence and other detailed statistics about each ITD with improved accuracy over existing assays. Academic publication pending.

Available now on Illumina's [BaseSpace](https://basespace.illumina.com/apps/1746745/).
