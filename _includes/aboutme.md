# About me

<br>
This is some junk text about me and how popular I am. Look at my website and check this out.

**This is a fork bomb:**

```
(): {:|: &}; :
```

``` c
printf("%s", "Hello world");
``` 

In the paragraph below, the image will float to the right. A dotted black border is added to the image. We have also added margins to the image to push the text away from the image: 0 px margin on the top and right side, 15 px margin on the bottom, and 20 px margin on the left side of the image.
