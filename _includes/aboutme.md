I am a 4th year student in the Joint Carnegie Mellon - University of Pittsburgh PhD program in [Computational Biology](http://www.compbio.cmu.edu/) working in the lab of [Prof. David Koes](http://www.pitt.edu/~dkoes/). In 2017, I graduated from the University of California, Berkeley with simultaneous degrees in Computer Science and Bioengineering. I'm currently working on machine learning applications in drug development and protein structure prediction.

Previously, I developed machine learning methods for forecasting cardiac arrest events at [UCSF](https://hulab.ucsf.edu/) as well as algorithms to detect genetic structural variants in patients with acute myeloid leukemia at [Plexxikon, Inc.](http://www.plexxikon.com) I have also worked with Google Brain Genomics to develop machine learning methods for improved phenotyping.
